# Master_Internship
The files in this repository are created and managed by Julia van Hees as part of her Master internship at the LUMC, the Netherlands.

In this project, we developed a clinical prediction model using logistic regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selector operator (LASSO).
Several steps were undertaken in model development and validation:
1. Preliminary analysis of the data (variable distribution and manipulations)
2. Imputation (R statistics MICE package)
3. Post-imputation checks (variable distributions)
4. Model development 
5. Model validation and updating
6. Model presentatin (figures and graphs)
7. Remaining code (calculations of predicted probabilities)
8. (Part of) a web-application in which our model is implemented
